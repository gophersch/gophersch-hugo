Go was released under the BSD license in 2009. Designed to develop backend servers,
its growth has been huge and it is used in a [great range of projects](http://awesome-go.com) today. From [virtualization](https://docker.io) to
[old game stations emulation](https://github.com/fogleman/nes), Go is a very helpful technology. 

Its main assets, I suppose, are its nice concurrency model and its proximity with C without the disadvantages of C. 

Moreover, the [team behind Go](http://blog.golang.org/a-conversation-with-the-go-team) is really great and Go is not their first attempt (Unix, UTF-8, ...)

You have to create a great HTTP API? You want to deal with low-level Unix signals? You want use websockets, FTTP, x509 natively without a JVM? 

Go is one perfect candidate for this. 

Before building the next generation of social network or new MMORPG backend, you may asked how could you dive smoothly into this technology?

My first advice would be to take a look at [a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) where you will be able to discover the basic concepts of the language and even play with it directly from your browser.

You can also take a look at this presentation: [An introduction to Go](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/gophersch/introduction-to-go/introduction.slide#1)

Once you get used to the syntax, I invite you to take a look at those links:
